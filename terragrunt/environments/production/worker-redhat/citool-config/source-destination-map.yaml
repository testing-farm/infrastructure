# The map file is used by archive module to map source to destination
# and optionally set permissions.
#
# The map provides 3 stages in which archiving is running:
# * execute - at the start of the pipeline
# * progress - parallel archiving during pipeline run
# * destroy - at the pipeline finish
#
# The format for source entry is next:
# - source: 'source'
#   destination: 'dest' # Optional
#   permissions: '777'  # Optional
#

execute:
  - source: "index.html"
    permissions: "777"

# Add tag repository with low priority, for installing additional dependencies of tested artifacts.
# The repository is DISABLED by default. We enable it only during artifact installation.
#
# The tag repository is updated by Koji. It contains all packages that got into a specific tag. The repository is sometimes
# also referred to as buildroot repository.
#
# Examples for Fedora:
# * rawhide contains all builds tagged into rawhide.
# * f32-build contains all builds tagged into f32-candidate or f32-updates-candidate.
#
# The play gracefully skips adding a tag repository which is not reachable.
